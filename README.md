# Getting Started
___

This was a project I followed along with for the [Vue JS 2 - The Complete Guide (incl. Vue Router & Vuex)](https://www.udemy.com/vuejs-2-the-complete-guide/learn/v4/overview) course on Udemy.

> ### 1. Clone the repo.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/bbcharlton/Vue_Quote_Project.git
```

> ### 2. Install dependencies.

```shell
npm install
```

This loads in all the dependencies used in the application.

> ### 3. Run Server.

```shell
npm run dev
```

This will use webpack and Babel to compile all code into a `bundle.js` file that runs on the page.

> ### 4. Open localhost:8080

Navigate to **localhost:8080** in your browser. The page should load a simple quote application.
